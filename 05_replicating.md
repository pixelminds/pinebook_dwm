# Making it reusable

Let's be honest - when using open source software, and particularly Linux, comes with lots of fun and possibilities, but you also get used to stability issues, and even the risk of a broken system once in a while. When you reach the sweet spot of your desired configuration, and start enjoying your productive setup, your start thinking about the next system crash.

In this context, one big concern is to make a particular setup reproducible. For this purpose, Linux expertise comes with collections of config files, also known as dotfiles (since they usually have a name starting with a dot, and hence hidden by default).

Replicating your current setup, therefore, is done by installing the core system, then the rest of applications, and finally recovering the dotfiles with all the tweaks and ricing.

This repository includes all this stories, plus all my dotfiles, so in case a crash happens, I'll be able to replicate the exact same configuration. Feel free to use it as is, or make your own tweaks.
