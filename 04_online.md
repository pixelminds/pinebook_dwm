## Going online

As soon as one starts putting some pieces of work together, the urge to keep a track of changes, versioning, and sharing comes out naturally.

We already managed getting online in the initial config. It was essential to get all the basic software. So there's only a few steps to get the missing tools for communication. 

First things first, we'll need an email client. I've been using Thunderbird for decades now. It has a perfect balance of simplified storage, complexity and flexibility, making altogether a sweet user experience. But in a minimalist environment it just doesn't feel dry enough. That's why I chose aerc instead, a CLI email client which, surprisingly, appeared as late as 2020.

Keeping files somewhere in the cloud is just as essential as version management, and git is the best tool for it, hands down.
