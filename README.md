The purpose of this project is to build up a keyboard-centric workflow on a PineBook Pro, an ARM-based laptop. This adventure started with a very simple idea: the need of a silent, fanless, minimalist laptop.

Once installed and configured, this workflow can be tweaked to the smallest detail. The path can be a bit overwhelming if you're not used to barebones Linux. But once you get the feeling, you can achieve unexpected productivity. A writing workflow around vim and dwm is somehow like a journey to the past, but it also feels like it makes a lot of sense. After working for several weeks on this setup, going back to my main desktop with KDE feels like a lot of bloat, like you're running hundreds of unnecesssary processes to do exactly the same: writing, browsing and checking your mail.

I decided to share all the configuration process, basically for myself to replicate, but also, why not, to let others save some time. If you're interested in any way, just keep reading the following chapters in any order.
